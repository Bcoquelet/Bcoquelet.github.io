DA2PL 2020 (From Multiple Criteria Decision Aid to Preference Learning) aims to bring together researchers from decision analysis and machine learning. It provides a forum for discussing recent advances and identifying new research challenges in the intersection of both fields, thereby supporting a cross-fertilisation of these disciplines.

Following the five previous editions of this workshop, which took place in Mons in 2012, Paris in 2014, Paderborn in 2016, Poznan in 2018, and Trento (virtually) in 2020, Compiègne in 2022, DA2PL 2025 will be held at the Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, dates.
